# Car-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project develops a machine learning model to predict car prices using features like brand, model, fuel type, and more. By applying supervised learning to historical data, it identifies patterns to estimate prices for new cars. This helps reduce negotiation inefficiencies, improve pricing accuracy, and enhance market transparency.
